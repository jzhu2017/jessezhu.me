# **About Me**

Hey there! I'm Jesse.
<br><br>
I'm a junior at Cornell University in the College of Engineering majoring in Computer Science, with an interest in natural language processing and machine learning, and minoring in business.
<br><br>
At Cornell, I'm an algorithms teaching assistant and a former discrete structures head teaching assistant. I'm involved in The Wardrobe and Thread Magazine at Cornell (click on the "Projects" section for more), as well as the Chinese Students Association, which focuses on Chinese cutural immersion, and Global Network, which focuses on advancing a globally aware and inclusive campus. Additionally, I'm a student brand ambassador for Kaplan and Education First on campus, helping to promote their brands through social media and holding events.

Outside of school, I'm passionate about photography, both creatively and professionally. The freedom and flexbility that comes with framing each shot captivates me. Also, I'm an avid learner of new languages and cultures. After participating in the German Study Trip program, where German-proficient leaders from 17 countries traveled the country to immerse themselves in German culture together, I've experienced the wonders that every culture has to offer. As such, I love enlightening myself about new cultures and languages. Currently, I'm learning Korean and Spanish as well, and know German and Chinese proficiently.
