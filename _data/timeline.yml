  description: Designed and built a user interface to run the Parmenides library which implements the Root and Rule extraction
               of natural language texts. This supports HTML, XML, TXT, Database, and CSV input. In addition, the display of the
               GUI is controlled by CSV files that the user can change and customize. Taxonomy and ontology visualizations
               were also developed. See more in the "Projects" section.

  description: Researched the ability of lightfield cameras to capture accurate 3D images needed for forensics, in particular, 
               to capture the details necessary for footprint extraction. The depth ability was compared with current
               foorprint extraction methods, and standards were created for such a task. See more in the "Projects" section.
